# RustyHelper

Simple BepInEx6 plugin that enabled you to configure the thresholds for Splunk to plant seeds, as well as show how many seeds you need to plant to reach your goal for unlocking a new crop.
Just drop it into BepInEx's `plugins` folder, run the game once and exit again. Then edit your RustyHelper config in `BepInEx/config/RustyHelper.cfg`.
